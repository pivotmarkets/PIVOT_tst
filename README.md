## Architecture

### Data Structures

#### `Market`
Core market structure containing:
- Market metadata (title, description, criteria)
- Trading pools (YES/NO reserves)
- Position tracking
- Analytics data
- Resolution status

#### `Position`
User position in a market:
- User address
- Outcome (YES=1, NO=2)
- Number of shares
- Average purchase price
- Timestamp

#### `TradeRecord`
Historical trade data:
- Trade type (BUY, SELL, ADD_LIQUIDITY, etc.)
- Amount and shares
- Prices before/after
- Timestamp and fees

#### `MarketAnalytics`
Comprehensive market metrics:
- Volume statistics
- Trade counts
- Unique traders
- Price history
- Fee totals

#### `MarketPool`
Market-specific liquidity pool:
- YES and NO reserves
- Total LP tokens
- LP provider balances
- Virtual reserves for price stability

### AMM Pricing (CPMM)

The contract uses a **Constant Product Market Maker (CPMM)** for pricing, based on the formula:

```
x * y = k
```

Where:
- `x` = YES reserve
- `y` = NO reserve
- `k` = constant product

The price for an outcome is calculated as:

```
Price(outcome) = outcome_reserve / (yes_reserve + no_reserve) * PRICE_PRECISION
```

This ensures:
- ‚úÖ Continuous liquidity
- ‚úÖ Prices sum to ~100%
- ‚úÖ Smooth price discovery
- ‚úÖ Stable market maker behavior

## Core Concepts

### Market States

1. **Active**: Market is open for trading
2. **Ended**: Past end time, awaiting resolution
3. **Resolved**: Oracle has determined outcome

### Outcomes

- **YES (1)**: Event will occur
- **NO (2)**: Event will not occur

### Trade Types

- `BUY`: Purchase position shares
- `SELL`: Sell position shares
- `ADD_LIQUIDITY`: Provide liquidity
- `REMOVE_LIQUIDITY`: Withdraw liquidity
- `CLAIM_WINNINGS`: Claim winning position payout
- `RESOLVE`: Resolve market outcome
- `CLAIM_LIQUIDITY`: Claim LP principal after resolution
